Software engineering is a field dedicated to the systematic design, development, testing,
and maintenance of software. By applying engineering principles to software creation,
software engineers ensure that applications are reliable, scalable, and efficient.
The process typically follows a structured approach known as the Software Development
Life Cycle (SDLC), which includes stages such as requirements gathering, design, coding,
testing, and deployment. With the rapid evolution of technology, software engineering has 
become vital for developing solutions that can meet complex user needs, adapt over time, 
and integrate with diverse systems.
