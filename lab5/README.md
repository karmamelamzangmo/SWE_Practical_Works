# Stack and Queue Implementations in Python

This project contains implementations of stack and queue data structures in Python, along with several functionalities that demonstrate their usage, including evaluating postfix expressions, implementing a queue using two stacks, creating a basic task scheduler, and converting infix expressions to postfix notation.

## Data Structures Implemented

1. **Stack**: A Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure.
2. **Queue**: A First In First Out (FIFO) data structure.
3. **Queue Using Two Stacks**: Implements a queue using two stacks to manage the order of elements.

## Features

- Evaluate postfix expressions using a stack.
- Convert infix expressions to postfix notation.
- Implement a basic task scheduler using a queue.
- Manage tasks in the order they were added.
