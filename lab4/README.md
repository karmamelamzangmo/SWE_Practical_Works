# Search Algorithms in Python

This project implements various search algorithms in Python, including Linear Search, Binary Search (iterative and recursive), Jump Search, and performance comparisons among them. The algorithms are designed to demonstrate their functionality and efficiency in finding elements in a list.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Linear Search**: A simple search algorithm that checks each element in the list sequentially until it finds the target or reaches the end of the list.
2. **Binary Search**: A more efficient search algorithm that works on sorted lists. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half.
   - Iterative version
   - Recursive version
3. **Jump Search**: An algorithm that works on sorted arrays by jumping ahead by fixed steps and then performing a linear search within the block.
4. **Insertion Point Search**: A function that finds the appropriate index to insert a new element in a sorted list.

## Features

- Count comparisons made during each search.
- Return all indices where the target appears in the Linear Search.
- Performance comparison of all algorithms on a large dataset.
