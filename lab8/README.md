# Sorting Algorithms Implementation and Comparison

This project provides Python implementations of several common sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and some optimized variations. The project also includes performance comparisons, a hybrid sorting algorithm, and a visualization tool using `matplotlib`.

## Implemented Sorting Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
2. **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively divides the list into halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.
3. **Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that selects a "pivot" element and partitions the list into elements less than and greater than the pivot, recursively sorting each partition.

### Code Examples

Each algorithm is implemented in Python as follows:

```python
# Bubble Sort
def bubble_sort(arr):
    ...
